**As you can see**, this syllabus page is very much in progress. We will add information here closer to the start of the quarter. If you're interested in taking the course and you have a question that isn't answered here, feel free to email Suraj.

## Motivation

TODO

## Prerequisites

We will only assume that you have taken or are taking DSC 10, and have taken at least one quarter of calculus before. Aside from that, we will make no assumptions regarding your background, and will introduce technical concepts at an introductory level when necessary.

## Class Meetings

This course will meet once a week. **The official schedule states that this course is from 6-8:50PM on Mondays, however we don't anticipate using the full timeslot each week.** Instead, we will use the first 1.5-2 hours to discuss the relevant material, and use the remaining time as an open discussion/office hours period.

## Assessments

TODO: participation, weekly reflections + problem sets.

## Acknowledgements
