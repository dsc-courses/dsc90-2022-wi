Topics are subject to change, and readings are all TBD. 01 January 3rd: Introduction, Calculus . In the first class session, we‚Äôll set the scene and expectations for the course. We‚Äôll study the historical development of calculus, a field that underpins much of modern data science. In doing so, we‚Äôll re-derive and use several results of early mathematicians to solve problems of our own. 02 January 10th: Aggregation, Least Squares, and Planetary Motion . We‚Äôve come to take for granted the idea of an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, but it was not always so prevalent. | Radical insights from The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom | Stigler, Stephen M. The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom. (Chapter 1) | Stigler, Stephen M.
