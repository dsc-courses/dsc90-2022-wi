### **1**{: .label .label-green } January 3rd: **Introduction, Calculus**

In the first class session, we'll set the scene and expectations for the course. We'll study the historical development of calculus, a field that underpins much of modern data science. In doing so, we'll re-derive and use several results of early mathematicians to solve problems of our own.

### **2**{: .label .label-green } January 10th: **Aggregation, Least Squares, and Planetary Motion**

We've come to take for granted the idea of an "average", but it was not always so prevalent.
