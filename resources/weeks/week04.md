## Homework 4 (due Sunday, February 6th at 11:59PM) 📝

Submit your answers as a PDF to Gradescope by the due date for full credit. We encourage you to discuss the readings and questions with others in the course, but all work must be your own. **Remember to use Campuswire if you need guidance!**

Homework 4 will be finalized by Tuesday.

<!-- ### Question 0

The Data Science Student Representatives created a survey for you to voice your opinion about what you love in DSC 90, and how we can improve your class and the department!

Feel free to talk about the topics covered in this course, the quality of the lectures, homeworks, and readings, and anything else you feel is relevant and constructive.

Please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUW_3PHsp_6XD0kKQMwU9Ck__aAgQDNGW8eBO1tDVce95ZCA/viewform) to complete the survey. If you aren't able to access it, make sure you're logged into your UCSD Google account.

### Question 1

Read this: https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1888-co-relations-rsoc.pdf

Defines probable error to be 1/2 (Q3 - Q1). And says now half of values are within +- 1.

test this out in a notebook, then prove it algebraically.

### Question 2

Method of deciles implementation question.

### Question 3

binomial maximum likelihood question

### Question 4

The journal used to be called Annals of Eugenics, what is it now called? And other reading problems. -->
