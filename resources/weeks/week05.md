## Homework 5 (due Sunday, February 13th at 11:59PM) 📝

Submit your answers as a PDF to Gradescope by the due date for full credit. We encourage you to discuss the readings and questions with others in the course, but all work must be your own. **Remember to use Campuswire if you need guidance!**

Homework 5 will be finalized by Tuesday.

<!-- ### Question 1

Something about Jakob Bernoulli, the law of large numbers, and DSC 10

### Question 2

something about the trial of the pyx?

### Question 3

Let's consider the Problem of the Points again, but pretend that each action is not fair. How could we modify our work?

### Question 4

Another early problem in probability was called the Gambler's Ruin. Describe it, show the numerical formula, ask to implement it, then simulate it. -->
